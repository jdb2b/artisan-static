    <p><b>Aleks Levental, CEO Feathr</b><br>
    "Dealing with SaaSwise has been one of the rare instances where someone manages to exceed lofty expectations. I could write several expansive paragraphs describing all of the components of our company they've influenced and improved (GTM, prospecting, sales enablement, customer success)."</p>

    <p><b>Eric Duffy, CEO Pathgather</b><br>
    "The approach that SaaSwise takes to building a successful business is quite rare and had a transformative impact on our team's sales and customer success goals. I can't thank them enough for elevating our business in the year leading up to our acquisition."</p>

    <p><b>David Hassell, CEO 15Five</b><br>
    "SaaSwise changed our company's trajectory by 10X. They worked across all of our teams to shift our focus to the highest value accounts and helped us hire all the key people on our go-to-market team. It's one of the best investments we've made with any partner."</p>
